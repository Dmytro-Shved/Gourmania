# **Practice the Fundamental Cooking Methods and Techniques**

The “cooking” part of cooking is really a long list of different techniques. 
Boiling, simmering, poaching, steaming, roasting, baking, grilling, broiling, frying, sauteing, and combination techniques like braising are all unique methods used for different results.

Each method affects the texture, flavor, and nutritional profile of the food in its own way. 
For example, steaming preserves more vitamins, while roasting can enhance natural sugars and create a caramelized exterior. 
Understanding these techniques allows a cook to choose the best approach for the ingredient and desired outcome.

### **Boiling**
Boiling is perhaps the simplest of all cooking methods, cooking food in hot liquid like water or stock at a temperature of at least 212°F.

### **Simmering and poaching**
Simmering and poaching are methods similar to boiling, in that they are moist-heat methods achieved in hot liquid, however they are executed at lower temperatures. 
Simmering is achieved at a temperature of around 180°F- 200°F, and poaching is done at a temperature between 160°F and 180°F.

### **Baking and Roasting**
Steaming is a fourth moist-heat method that is achieved by allowing hot vapor generated from liquid to cook the food, and it’s considered one of the gentlest cooking methods.

### **Sautéeing**
Heat oil or butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add evenly cut ingredients, spreading them in one layer. Stir or toss frequently until browned and tender. Keep heat steady, avoid overcrowding, and season just before finishing.
