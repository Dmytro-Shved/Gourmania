### **High-quality chef’s knife**
We do not recommend using cheap knives, as they tend to dull quickly, rust, and negatively impact your workflow. 
Investing in a full-tang carbon steel chef’s knife will significantly enhance your kitchen efficiency. 
Look for a model that feels right in your hand, and make sure to sharpen and hone it regularly.

### **Affordable paring knives**
Lightweight and easy to clean, paring knives are ideal for quick slicing tasks. 
We recommend keeping several on hand. Budget-friendly options such as Kiwi brand knives offer excellent performance at a low price and are perfect for small tasks where a chef’s knife is not needed.

### **Durable cutting boards**
Epicurean cutting boards are a practical middle ground between plastic and heavy wooden boards. 
Made from compressed paper, they are lightweight, knife-friendly, and easy to clean by hand. 
For added safety, choose models with silicone grips for extra stability.

### **Precise digital kitchen scale**
A digital kitchen scale is essential not only for baking but for any precise recipe. 
Whether you're brewing coffee or scaling up recipes, a scale accurate to at least 1g—or even 0.1g—is invaluable. 
This allows for repeatable results and easier adjustments.

### **Measuring cups and spoons**
Proper measurement is key to recipe success. 
We recommend using dry measuring cups for solids and liquid measuring cups for liquids. 
For organization and accuracy, we prefer the magnetic dry cups and ergonomic liquid cups by OXO.

### **Instant-read thermometer**
Ensure food safety and consistency with an instant-read thermometer. 
It helps prevent under- or overcooked meals, especially for meats, coffee brewing, yogurt, and bread.
Even budget models today offer great accuracy and speed.

### **Silicone spatulas**
These versatile tools are ideal for scraping bowls, stirring batters, and sautéing. 
Opt for heat-resistant silicone options with ergonomic handles. 
Models from OXO are long-lasting and easy to clean.

### **Metal spatulas and turners**
Metal turners offer excellent control for flipping burgers, fish, and more. 
We suggest models compatible with your cookware—metal for cast iron, silicone for non-stick. 
OXO and Sur La Table offer reliable, comfortable designs.

### **Stainless steel and silicone-tipped tongs**
Tongs provide safe and precise handling of hot food. 
For best results, choose spring-loaded tongs with pull-tab locks. 
Use silicone tips for non-stick cookware and bare stainless steel for better grip in cast iron or stainless pans.

### **Efficient garlic press**
A garlic press streamlines prep work for garlic-heavy dishes. 
Look for models with ergonomic handles and easy-to-clean components. 
The OXO garlic press stands out for its ease of use and built-in cleaning tool.
